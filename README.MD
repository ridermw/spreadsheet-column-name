Hi Anuj,

I was not satisfied with my answer I gave during the coding challenge.  So I wanted to work some more on it
and hopefully come up with a better answer.  I created this project for you to show a better solution.  I commit
my changes every so often so you can look back through the history to see my progress. 

Thank you for your consideration.

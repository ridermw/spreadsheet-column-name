Hi Anuj,

I was not satisfied with my answer I gave during the coding challenge.  So I wanted to work some more on it
and hopefully come up with a better answer.  I created this project for you to show a better solution.  I commit
my changes every so often so you can look back through the history to see my progress. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Given a non-negative integer, compute the spreadsheet column name that its associated with.

| 25   | Z  |
| 26   | AA  |

| 52   | BA  |
| 702   | AAA  |
